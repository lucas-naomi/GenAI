# Generative AI

## Overview

Generative AI refers to the technology that can analyze data to discover relationships and predictable sequences, allowing it to create new outputs such as text, images, and sounds. This is achieved through models that can represent and adapt to various forms of data.

**A Brief History of Artificial Intelligence** The history of AI dates back to 1950 when Alan Turing, often referred to as the father of AI, introduced the concept of machines capable of intelligent thought. Since then, AI has evolved significantly, with developments in neural networks and generative AI driven by advances in hardware and algorithms.
