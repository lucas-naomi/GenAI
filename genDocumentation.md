# Generative AI

## Overview

Generative AI refers to the technology that can analyze data to discover relationships and predictable sequences, allowing it to create new outputs such as text, images, and sounds. This is achieved through models that can represent and adapt to various forms of data.

**A Brief History of Artificial Intelligence** The history of AI dates back to 1950 when Alan Turing, often referred to as the father of AI, introduced the concept of machines capable of intelligent thought. Since then, AI has evolved significantly, with developments in neural networks and generative AI driven by advances in hardware and algorithms.

## Data Annotation
Annotated data, labeled manually by humans, is crucial for supervised learning. This process is time-consuming and expensive but necessary for training accurate models.
Take for instance that you want to develop a program to single out dogs in images. You must go through the rigorous process of feeding it with multiple labeled pictures of dogs and “non-dogs” to help the model learn what dogs look like. The program will then be able to compare new images with its existing repository to find out whether an image contains a dog in it.
Though the process is repetitive at the beginning, if enough annotated data is fed to the model, it will be able to learn how to identify or classify items in new data automatically without the need of labels. For the process to be successful, high quality annotated data is required. This is why most developers choose to use human resources for the annotation process.
The process might be automatized by using a machine to prepopulate the data, but a human touch and a human eye is preferred for review when the data is nuanced or sensitive. The higher the quality of annotated data fed to the training model, the higher the quality of the output. It is also important to note that most AI algorithms require regular updates to keep up with changes. Some may be updated as often as every day.
